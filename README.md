# Camera Calibration and Intrinsic Matrix Computation README

## Libraries Required

Ensure the following libraries are installed before executing the code:

- `opencv`: For computer vision tasks such as feature detection and image processing.
- `numpy`: For numerical computations and matrix operations.
- `scipy`: For scientific computing and technical computing.
- `glob`: For file pathnames matching.

## Problem 1: Projection and Transformation Matrices Calculation

### Execution Instructions

Run the code in the terminal to obtain the following outputs:

1. Projection Matrix (P)
2. Intrinsic Matrix (K)
3. Rotation Matrix (R)
4. Translation Matrix (T)
5. Reprojection errors for each point
6. Mean reprojection error

## Problem 2: Checkerboard Calibration

### Execution Instructions

Run the code in the terminal for these outputs:

1. Display of all 13 images with the detected checkerboard corners (press 'Q' to advance to the next image)
2. Camera intrinsic matrix (K)
3. Reprojection error for each individual image
4. Mean reprojection error

### File Paths

- Update the path for the `glob` function to match the directory structure on your system where the images are stored.

## Additional Information

- The source codes and the PDF report are provided within the zip file.
